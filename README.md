# Domare
A web-based tool to generate image-sequences for 3D fulldome settings, such as [Wisdome](https://wisdomeproject.se/). See below for the demo application, or use the `src/domare.js` file directly in your [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) project.

## Demo
Simply go to https://akodiat.github.io/domare to try the app yourself.

### Running locally
To run it locally, you need to start a static HTTP server in this directory. You can easily do that with the following Python command ([or any of these other options](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255))

```sh
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then, you can go to [localhost:8080](HTTP:/localhost:8080) (or whatever port you used above) to view the app.
